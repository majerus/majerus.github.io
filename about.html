## About

I develop tools and tech for higher ed.  At Colby, I oversee the Prospect Research team and develop new approaches to modeling and visualizing fundraising data.  I also serve on the campaign leadership and principal gifts teams and have developed proposals for 8-figure charitable contributions. 

Here are a few other things of note:

  - With three parterns, I founded and sold the IP for a successful and profitable stats consulting firm;
  - I have had the opportunity to work at several great colleges, including Carleton, Colby, and Reed; 
  - I like teaching...I  taught Latin and recently "retired" from teaching online courses in sociology; and
  - My <a href="https://gallery.shinyapps.io/college_explorer-master/">College Explorer</a> app is featured in RStudio's Showcase and I am on their <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/instructors/">list of consultants</a>. 

Thanks for checking out my new website. It is still a work in progress as I learn more about Github Pages and the { Personal } Jekyll Theme.  The art featured above is by <a href="http://www.krop.com/brookevertin/#/">Brooke Vertin</a>.
