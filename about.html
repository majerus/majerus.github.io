## About

I live on a farmette in Central Maine, where my wife and I grow berries, fruit, veggies and flowers.  When I'm not outside, I develop tools and tech for higher ed.  At Colby, I oversee the Prospect Research team and develop new approaches to modeling and visualizing fundraising data.  I also serve on the campaign leadership and principal gifts teams and have developed proposals for 8-figure charitable contributions. 

Here are a few other things of note:

  - With three partners, I founded and sold the IP for a successful and profitable stats consulting firm;
  - A one-page version of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By8BaMrUTYCCbGlqbzJ2NUhnTXM/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">resume</a> is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By8BaMrUTYCCbGlqbzJ2NUhnTXM/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> (current as of June 2016);
  - I have had the opportunity to work at several great colleges, including Carleton, Colby, and Reed; 
  - I like teaching...I  taught Latin and recently "retired" from teaching online courses in sociology; and
  - My <a href="https://gallery.shinyapps.io/college_explorer-master/" target="_blank">College Explorer</a> app is featured in RStudio's Showcase and I am on their <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/instructors/" target="_blank">list of consultants</a>.
