10:00 AM – 10:50 AM

Too many custom report requests? Disappointed with one-size fits all reporting solutions? Learn how to develop your own customized and interactive reporting solution for free using R and Shiny. Attendees will see a live demo of Colby College's custom built web-based advancement reporting system and will learn how to get started with R and Shiny. Colby's Prospect Finder system has automated the Advancement Division's reporting and provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface that encourages data-informed decision-making.

Presenter: Rich Majerus, Director of Advancement Strategy and Analysis, Colby College
